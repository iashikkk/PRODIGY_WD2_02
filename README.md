Weather Application Step-by-Step Workflow
User Input:
The user types the city name in the search bar and clicks the search button.

API Request:
JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the user's input (city name).

API Response:
The API returns weather data in JSON format (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather condition).

Data Processing:
JavaScript parses the API response and filters out relevant information (e.g., temperature, weather description).

Data Display:
The processed weather data is dynamically displayed in the HTML elements, where the user can see the temperature and weather condition.
